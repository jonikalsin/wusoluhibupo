She was first seen watching one of <a href=# title="Y (Adventures)">Y</a>'s failed attempts to get <a href=# title="X (Adventures)">X</a> to leave his house and come outside. Later, the <a href=# title="Legendary Pokémon">Legendary Pokémon</a> <a href=# title="Xerneas (Pokémon)">Xerneas</a> and <a href=# title="Yveltal (Pokémon)">Yveltal</a> appeared in Vaniville Town and began fighting, causing mass panic and destruction. Using her <a href=# title="Rhyhorn (Pokémon)">Rhyhorn</a> racing skills, Y managed to get Shauna, <a href=# title="Trevor (Adventures)">Trevor</a>, and <a href=# title="Tierno (Adventures)">Tierno</a> to safety, but an explosion sent Shauna's <a href=# title="Furfrou (Pokémon)">Furfrou</a>, Furry, flying. Once X was retrieved, Y decided that with their home destroyed, the best option was to leave town. Shauna and her friends then set off on a journey, together for the first time in years.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS551>Inn-teresting Developments</a></i>, the group arrived in <a href=# title="Aquacorde Town">Aquacorde Town</a>. Shauna, Y, Trevor, and Tierno stayed at an inn for the night while X slept in the tent on Y's Rhyhorn's back. The inn was a trap designed to keep Shauna and the others locked inside while the <a href=# title="Team Flare">Team Flare</a> scientists <a href=# title=Aliana>Aliana</a> and <a href=# title=Mable>Mable</a> attempted to take X's <a href=# title="Kanga and Li'l Kanga">Li'l Kanga</a> while he wasn't looking. Y broke free and informed X of the situation, but when he tried to <a href=# title="Mega Evolution">Mega Evolve</a> Li'l Kanga, it failed. Having no other options, X and Y used the <a href=# title=Marisso>Chespin</a> and <a href=# title=Croaky>Froakie</a> Trevor got from <a href=# title="Professor Sycamore">Professor Sycamore</a> to defeat the scientists.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS554>Kangaskhan...Kangascan't</a></i>, the group stocked up on supplies in <a href=# title="Santalune City">Santalune City</a>. There, they met <a href=# title=Viola>Viola</a>, who allowed everyone to investigate photos she took of the Vaniville incident at the <a href=# title="Santalune Gym">Santalune Gym</a>. Despite Y telling everyone to be wary of adults they didn't know, she and the others cautiously accepted Viola's offer. Frustrated and confused by this behavior, Shauna refused to go and ran off. Later, Shauna encountered an experienced Furfrou stylist. The stylist allowed Shauna to practice on his Furfrou and handed her a <a href=# title="Honedge (Pokémon)">Honedge</a>, claiming it was a tool used by novices. The stylist turned out to be the Team Flare scientist <a href=# title=Celosia>Celosia</a>, who used her Honedge to possess Shauna.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS555>The Aegislash Agenda</a></i>, the possessed Shauna was found by Y and taken to the Gym. That night, Shauna attempted to steal Kanga's <a href=# title=Kangaskhanite>Kangaskhanite</a>, but was caught by Y and Viola. Shauna attacked Y, only for Viola to push her out of the way and take the hit. When Celosia came and took the stone, Shauna started resisting the mind control and went on a rampage before passing out. X teamed up with <a href=# title=Korrina>Korrina</a>, another <a href=# title="Gym Leader">Gym Leader</a> and fellow user of Mega Evolution, to defeat Celosia and retrieve the <a href=# title="Mega Stone">Mega Stone</a>. Later, Shauna woke up and apologized to Y for her earlier behavior. After learning that X obtained his <a href=# title="Mega Ring">Mega Ring</a> without the proper succession ceremony, Korrina refused to acknowledge X as a true Mega Evolution Successor and angrily left without telling him more about it.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS558>What Does Charmander Do When It Dozes</a></i>, the group arrived at Professor Sycamore's laboratory in <a href=# title="Lumiose City">Lumiose City</a>. X stayed behind while Shauna and the others went to <a href=# title="Lysandre Labs">Lysandre Café</a> to have Trevor's broken <a href=# title="Holo Caster">Holo Caster</a> repaired. The group was introduced to <a href=# title=Lysandre>Lysandre</a>, an inventor and owner of the café. Upon seeing Lysandre's silhouette in a photo of the Vaniville incident, Trevor became suspicious of the man. Noticing Trevor's strange behavior, Lysandre asked to see the photo, even sending out his Pokémon to surround the group when Trevor refused. Shauna and the others were rescued by <a href=# title=Diantha>Diantha</a>, who used her Mega <a href=# title="Diantha's Gardevoir">Gardevoir</a> to convince Lysandre to back off. After saying farewell to Diantha, Shauna and the others met back up with X and Sycamore.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS562>Pangoro Poses a Problem</a></i>, Sycamore went inside the <a href=# title="Lumiose Gym">Prism Tower</a> to have an interview. While the group waited outside, X sensed danger and led everyone inside to investigate. There, they found <a href=# title=Alexa>Alexa</a> under attack by the <a href=# title="Lumiose Press editor-in-chief">Lumiose Press editor-in-chief</a>. X battled and defeated the editor-in-chief's <a href=# title="Pangoro (Pokémon)">Pangoro</a>, rescuing Alexa's <a href=# title="Helioptile (Pokémon)">Heli</a> in the process. Fearing Lumiose wasn't safe for them either, Shauna and the others left town while Alexa went to stay with Viola. As they left, an <a href=# title="Electrike (Pokémon)">Electrike</a> that helped power the Prism Tower started following X.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS565>Fast-Thinking Froakie</a></i>, Y's clothes were taken by the Electrike that had been following the group. Electrike was defeated by Y's Croaky, but it only wanted Y to retrieve a <a href=# title=Manectite>Manectite</a> that was stuck on a tree. Y initially refused, but was convinced to help when Electrike evolved into a <a href=# title="Manectric (Pokémon)">Manectric</a> while sitting on her head. The group was approached by <a href=# title=Clemont>Clemont</a>, the Lumiose City Gym Leader, who offered to help find the stone with one of his inventions. Before Clemont could grab the stone, a <a href=# title="Team Flare Grunt (Trainer class)">Team Flare Grunt</a> stole it and ran away. While X and Trevor chased the Grunt and Y helped remove a tree that fell on top of Clemont, Shauna and Tierno fought the Grunt's four <a href=# title="Espurr (Pokémon)">Espurr</a>. They were later helped by <a href=# title=Cassius>Cassius</a>, who easily defeated the Espurr.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS570>Dancing Vivillon</a></i>, Cassius used a helicopter to transport Shauna and the others to <a href=# title="Cyllage City">Cyllage City</a>, where Clemont had seen Y's mother <a href=# title="Grace (Kalos)">Grace</a> being taken away by Team Flare members. The vehicle was attacked by a group of students from Y's <a href=# title="Sky Trainer (Trainer class)">Sky Trainer</a> school. Together, Y and X defeated the Sky Trainers as well as Celosia's <a href=# title="Aegislash (Pokémon)">Aegislash</a>, who was manipulating them in secret. The damage dealt to the helicopter caused a propeller blade to snap off and hit Y, sending her crashing down to <a href=# title="Kalos Route 9">Route 9</a>. Cassius made an emergency landing in Cyllage, but the damage done to the cycling area angered the Cyllage City Gym Leader, <a href=# title=Grant>Grant</a>. While Cassius dealt with Grant, Shauna and the others left him behind to search for Y. Shauna and Tierno suggested that after Y was found, they should find Team Flare's base and confront the villains there.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS573>Gathering Klefki</a></i>, Shauna and the others found Y on <a href=# title="Kalos Route 8">Route 8</a>. Y informed everyone that Team Flare planned to use mind-controlled Vanville Town residents as forced labor to move the dormant tree form of Xerneas back to their hideout and have it power a device known as the <a href=# title="Ultimate weapon">ultimate weapon</a>. The group decided to let Team Flare take the tree so they could follow the villains back to their hideout. Later, Celosia arrived to oversee the operation to move Xerneas. Noticing her mother among the laborers, Y leapt in to save her, only for her Sky Suit to fail due to the damages it sustained earlier. X attempted to have Li'l Kanga and <a href=# title=Élec>Élec</a> Mega Evolve at the same time, but it failed, giving <a href=# title=Emma>Essentia</a> the chance to capture everyone with her <a href=# title="Trevenant (Pokémon)">Trevenant</a>. Celosia tried to kill X, but was stopped by the timely arrival of Korrina, Diantha, and <a href=# title=Gurkinn>Gurkinn</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS575>Changing Gengar</a></i>, Korrina and Diantha faced Team Flare while Gurkinn freed Shauna and the others. With his newly-obtained <a href=# title="Gengar (Pokémon)">Garma</a> he received from Gurkinn, X defeated Essentia, forcing her to run away. X, Trevor, and Tierno went ahead to help Korrina while Shauna and Y tried to break the <a href=# title="Magic Room (move)">Magic Room</a> <a href=# title=Malva>Malva</a> trapped herself and Diantha inside, but despite their efforts, the barrier eventually sank into the ground. X's group found Korrina, only to discover that Celosia managed to defeat her. Korrina succeeded in freeing the townspeople from Celosia's control, but couldn't prevent Xerneas from being taken and had her <a href=# title="Key Stone">Key Stone</a> stolen as well.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS577>Quilladin Stands</a></i>, the rescued townspeople and Korrina were taken to a hospital in <a href=# title="Laverre City">Laverre City</a>. Shauna, Y, and Tierno trained together with Gurkinn's assistance. Later, Trevor informed everyone that X disappeared and presented them a pair of glasses he left behind. When the glasses broadcasted an image of <a href=# title="Geosenge Town">Geosenge Town</a>, everyone realized the glasses belonged to Clemont and concluded that X learned the location of the <a href=# title="Team Flare Secret HQ">Team Flare Secret HQ</a> and went there by himself. Shauna, Y, Trevor, Tierno, and the Kalos Gym Leaders followed X to Geosenge Town, but as soon as they arrived, everyone witnessed the ultimate weapon emerging from underground like a flower bud. To prevent the weapon from blooming, Y and the Gym Leaders tried keeping the petals in place by force.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS580>Flabébé Blooms</a></i>, Shauna, Trevor, and Shauna avoided <a href=# title=Bryony>Bryony</a>'s attacks and made it inside the Secret HQ. There, they reunited with Clemont and freed <a href=# title=AZ>AZ</a>, a giant man that was held prisoner. Shauna and the others found X, who managed to revive Xerneas, but lost to Lysandre, the leader of Team Flare. Shauna, Trevor, and Tierno tried removing the ultimate weapon's key, but were unable to pull it out in time before it fired. To Lysandre's frustration, the combined efforts of X, his friends, and the Gym Leaders successfully weakened the ultimate weapon, preventing it from taking any innocent lives. AZ stayed behind to allow Xerneas to take Shauna and the others back to the surface. Once everyone reunited with Y, Xerneas joined her team and was <a href=# title=Nickname>nicknamed</a> <a href=# title=Xerxer>Xerxer</a>. Y told Xerxer to destroy the ultimate weapon, but they were interrupted by Malva, who managed to capture Yveltal. Due to Xerneas and Yveltal being evenly matched, <a href=# title=Xerosic>Xerosic</a> announced that Lysandre ordered a ceasefire. Xerxer confirmed this and retreated, taking Shauna and the others with it.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS582>Pinsir Glares</a></i>, the group rested at the <a href=# title="Lost Hotel">Lost Hotel</a>. <a href=# title=Ramos>Ramos</a> revealed that Team Flare blamed the destruction caused by the ultimate weapon on the Vaniville children and the Gym Leaders. He advised Shauna and the others to keep hiding from the public while the Gym Leaders helped rebuild the damaged areas. Y received a Key Stone and Mega Ring from Gurkinn, officially making her a Mega Evolution Successor. Later, on <a href=# title="Kalos Route 15">Route 15</a>, X and Y looked for Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution to catch. During X's search for a <a href=# title="Pinsir (Pokémon)">Pinsir</a>, the group encountered <a href=# title="Blue (Adventures)">Blue</a>, another Trainer from the <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a> region, and Diantha, who was rescued by Blue earlier. Trevor received a call from Sycamore, who asked everyone to meet him in <a href=# title="Anistar City">Anistar City</a> so he could aid them on their journey.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/0/0a/Shauna_Furfrou_Trimmer_Adventures.png/300px-Shauna_Furfrou_Trimmer_Adventures.png decoding=async width=200 height=276 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Shauna as a Furfrou stylist<p>In <i><a href=# title=PS584>Hawlucha Attacks</a></i>, Shauna and the others arrived in Anistar, where they found Sycamore under attack by a group of <a href=# title="Hawlucha (Pokémon)">Hawlucha</a>. Once taken to safety, Sycamore revealed that ultimate weapon's blast affected the Key Stones, giving them the ability to track Mega Stones, but only from 8 PM to 9 PM. When X noted the Hawlucha were under a Trainer's command, Shauna and Tierno decided to search for the Mega Stones while X and Y stayed behind to protect the professor.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS586>Zygarde Appears</a></i>, Shauna and Tierno searched for Mega Stones. On <a href=# title="Kalos Route 19">Route 19</a>, Shauna and Tierno came across a large group of Pokémon that were drained of their life energy. Though horrified at the sight, they continued the mission and moved an unconscious <a href=# title="Aggron (Pokémon)">Aggron</a> to get the stone underneath it. Shauna and Tierno returned to Anistar, where they returned the Mega Rings and handed over the <a href=# title=Pinsirite>Pinsirite</a> and <a href=# title=Absolite>Absolite</a> needed to Mega Evolve Rute and <a href=# title="Absol (Pokémon)">Solsol</a> into Mega Pinsir and Mega Absol. Essentia retaliated by sending out Xerxer, who she took control of with her Expansion Suit's Poké Ball Jack function. X and Y combined their attacks to damage Essentia's suit and free Xerxer from her control. The battle was interrupted by the arrival of <a href=# title="Zygarde (Adventures)">Zygarde</a>, who had come to suppress Xerxer's power. Essentia chose to shift her priorities by capturing Zygarde and had her Trevenant bind it. Zygarde tried powering itself up by absorbing the power of nature, but this left it completely defenseless, allowing Essentia to easily catch it and escape. Afterward, Sycamore received a call from Sina and Dexio, who found out that Team Flare went into hiding in the <a href=# title="Pokémon Village">Pokémon Village</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS587>Malamar Traps</a></i>, Shauna, her friends, Blue, and Diantha set off to confront Team Flare at the Pokémon Village. Along the way, the group was attacked by Xerosic, who had his <a href=# title="Malamar (Pokémon)">Malamar</a> put everyone to sleep with <a href=# title="Hypnosis (move)">Hypnosis</a>. By evolving into a <a href=# title="Greninja (Pokémon)">Greninja</a>, Croaky worked with X to battle Xerosic. Croaky was eventually defeated, but successfully woke the others up. X and Blue stayed behind to keep Xerosic busy while Shauna and the others went ahead. The remaining Team Flare scientists intercepted Shauna's group to separate them for one-on-one battles. Shauna's opponent was Celosia.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS593>Xerneas Gives</a></i>, Shauna's <a href=# title="Skitty (Pokémon)">Neko</a> defeated Celosia's <a href=# title="Doublade (Pokémon)">Doublade</a> after dulling its edges with <a href=# title="Play Rough (move)">Play Rough</a>. Celosia tried influencing Shauna's mind with her Aegislash again, only for <a href=# title="Korrina's Lucario">Korrina's Lucario</a> to appear, revealing its <a href=# title=Aura>Aura</a> was keeping Shauna safe the entire time. Shauna then commanded Lucario to attack Celosia, taking her and her Aegislash out at the same time. After meeting with Trevor and Tierno, Aliana was taken down as well. Shauna and the others went to meet X's group at the village, only to find Xerxer in battle with Yveltal. Xerxer informed everyone that it and Yveltal were returning to their dormant tree and cocoon forms, ensuring that Zygarde would have no reason to remain in Kalos. This allowed X to launch one final attack and completely separate Zygarde into its Cells, leading to Lysandre's defeat. With Team Flare's schemes foiled, Shauna and her friends said farewell to their allies and returned to Lumiose City, where the townsfolk went about their daily lives as if nothing had happened.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=PS594>Floette Returns</a></i>, AZ approached the Vaniville children and revealed he created the ultimate weapon. Noting how the people shunned Shauna and her friends despite their hard work, AZ suggested Team Flare's ambitions weren't wrong and went to go activate the ultimate weapon again. Everyone tried stopping AZ, but he retaliated with his <a href=# title="Golurk (Pokémon)">Golurk</a>. When one of Golurk's attacks was about to hit Y, AZ stepped in and took the attack himself. AZ survived, but the ultimate weapon's key was destroyed. The battle was merely an act to prevent Shauna and the others from heading down the path Lysandre took. With his mind at ease, AZ thanked the Vaniville children, only to be shocked at the return of the <a href=# title="Floette (Pokémon)">Floette</a> that left him 3,000 years ago. After saying goodbye to AZ, the group was greeted by Sycamore, the Gym Leaders, Alexa, <a href=# title=Bonnie>Bonnie</a>, and <a href=# title=Yvette>Yvette</a>. Clemont returned Shauna's Furry to her, revealing it was one of the Pokémon Team Flare captured for a source of life energy. Sycamore proposed a party and parade as a celebration for the Vaniville Children's efforts, but they refused. Shauna and her friends returned home, where Y reunited with her mother.</p><p>Three months later, Shauna was revealed to have become a Furfrou stylist in Lumiose City. She was then called to attend X's Mega Evolution Successor ceremony in <a href=# title="Shalour City">Shalour City</a> by Korrina.</p><h2><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon>Pokémon</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=On_hand>On hand</span></h3><h5><span class=mw-headline id=Temporary>Temporary</span></h5><table align=left width=100%><tbody readability=3.5533498759305><tr><td colspan=2 rowspan=2 width=25% align=center><a href=# class=image title="Shauna's Honedge"><img alt="Shauna's Honedge" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/2/2d/Shauna_Honedge_Adventures.png/300px-Shauna_Honedge_Adventures.png decoding=async width=200 height=206 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b><span id=Honedge></span>Honedge</b></td></tr><tr readability=8.4807692307692><td rowspan=5 align=left width=75% readability=4.7115384615385><a href=# title="Honedge (Pokémon)">Honedge</a> was given to Shauna by <a href=# title=Celosia>Celosia</a> when she was disguised as a <a href=# title="Furfrou (Pokémon)">Furfrou</a> stylist.
